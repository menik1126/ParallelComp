She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
        "answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
        "pred": "Janet eats 3 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 3 = <<16-3=13>>13 eggs left for sale.\nShe sells each egg for $2, so she makes $2 x 13 = $<<2*13=26>>26 per day from selling eggs at the farmers' market.\nShe also bakes 4 muffins per day and sells each for $4, so she makes $4 x 4 = $<<4*4=16>>16 per day from muffins.\nIn total, Janet makes $26 + $16 = $<<26+16=42>>42 per day at the farmers' market.\nThe answer is 42"
